# usa-state-quiz
USA Map with state info by clicking on each state.

I created this project to use as a state info quiz for young children, but also to learn some JSON and jquery.
It started out as just the state and state capital, and then I added state flower, bird and tree to the JSON array of state info.

I thought about adding some political info to it in a new version, like the current senators and congress people, but haven't gotten around to that yet.
